## Google Forms Spammer

I was trying to write a script that would help spam randomized data to a Google Forms survey in need of ridiculous amounts of fabricated data.

Unfortunately does not work for forms of multiple pages because of the way Google Forms work.  

An alternative idea to doing this is by using Selenium Web Driver to simulate browser activites instead of POSTing data directly to the server, but that would take way too much effort for this dumb little activity of mine to pass time.
